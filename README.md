🙋‍♂️ Hello, I’m **Kilian**, a **French software engineer** passionate about **development**, **visual creation**, and **innovation**.

💻 Since **2019**, I’ve specialized in **software and backend engineering** with strong expertise in **network infrastructure**, **server architecture**, and **DevOps**. My core stack includes **Python**, **JavaScript** (Node.js, TypeScript), **.NET/C#**, **PHP**, and **SQL**. I also have solid front-end foundations with **HTML**, **CSS**, **React**, and various UI libraries.

🤖 I have a strong interest in **AI technologies** and regularly integrate **machine learning** and **automation features** into my projects, especially to enhance user experience or optimize back-end processes.

👷‍♂️ I’m particularly focused on **scalable and high-availability systems**, with advanced knowledge of **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS services**. I operate daily in **Linux environments** and have hands-on experience with **CI/CD pipelines** and **API design**.

🎭 Beyond code, I’m deeply passionate about **photography** and **video production**, especially in the **music scene**, where I’ve earned a privileged place through my creative work. At just **16**, I started working as a freelance developer, and I’m currently building a **full-featured SaaS platform** dedicated to modern customer support.

👁️ Whether it’s crafting robust back-end systems, building intelligent tools, or capturing emotion through a lens, I bring the same energy: **precision**, **creativity**, and **relentless curiosity**.
